Snake for 2 players on the same keyboard?! Saucy.

Try it out [here](http://rileyjshaw.github.io/2p-snake/). There's still a ways to go, so check out the [issue log](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/2p-snake/issues) if you want to contribute. If it's not on the issue log but it's a great idea, go for it!

Not hard enough? No friends to play with? Masochist? Sounds like you should try ULTIMATE 1P AMBIDEXTROUS MODE (...which is the exact same game for now).
